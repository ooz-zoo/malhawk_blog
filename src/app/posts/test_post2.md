# Hello World!
This is **Markdown** content rendered in a Next.js blog. We'll cover features like lists, code, and even nested headings.

## Why Markdown?

### Simplicity
Markdown is readable and minimal—no bloated tags, just clean text.

### Portability
Works across GitHub, blogs, and README files without needing to change formats.

## Features
Here are some key features we can use:

### Task Lists
- [x] Static site generation
- [x] Syntax highlighting
- [x] Easy authoring
- [ ] Deploy preview support

### Code Highlighting

```js
// A simple console log
console.log("Test Blog part 2 Works!");
